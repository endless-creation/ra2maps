# [YOBA] Yuri's Online Battle Arena
- Current version: `1.4`

## Rules
- Push down the lanes and destroy the enemy nexus to win
- Fully functional towers featuring the visage of Yuri! They hurt!
- Jungle camps (neutral enemies) that drop rewards and respawn on a timer
- The jungle is covered in shroud
- Ore Refineries disabled, build and capture Oil Derricks to generate more cash
- Creep waves that spawn on a timer in each lane and attack the enemy base. They can NOT
  be controlled by players.  You can tell which units are controlled by AI because they
  are Yuri faction units only.
- Destroy the enemy inhibitors to stop your opponent's creep waves
- Inhibitors are invulnerable until all towers in the lane are destroyed
- The nexus is invulnerable until at least one inhibitor is destroyed
- Elite bosses that will give you yuge rewards
- No superweapons, No Yuri faction, No France


## Tips
- Turrets are strong! Do not attempt to fight another army under an enemy turret, you
  will lose most of your units.
- Turrets can NOT be repaired.  Slowly chip away at them when they are undefended.
- Use your friendly creep waves as fodder when attacking turrets.
- Use scouts in the jungle to keep tabs on enemy movement
- Attack your opponent through the jungle from different angles, denying their
  resources and vision
- Use the shroud to your advantage, hide your units to deny your opponent information
